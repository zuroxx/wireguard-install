# Unattended WireGuard installer

Easily set up a dual-stack [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) VPN on a Linux server with less human interaction. Â©Automate the effect.

## Requirements

Supported distributions:

- Ubuntu
- Debian
- Centos

Still works, but attended:

- Arch
- Fedora

## Host

Prefeably a cloud host running KVM such as GCP, AWS, Vultr (actual unlimited bandwidth). Check for the egress costs of your host. Also Azure, I'm running some budget VMs on their, "Standard B1ls (1 vcpus, 0.5 GiB memory)" while very slow to install, it can be a cost effective option. Digital Ocean is not recommended for a VPN due to continual DMCA disconnects from false positives.
